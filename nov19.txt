The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

        int s = 0;
        while(x>0){
            x = x&(x-1);
            s++;

        return s;
